# Agent Operating Contracts — Overview

OpenRook uses a contract-first approach so every agent operates with clear role boundaries, handoff behaviour, runtime constraints, and measurable outcomes.

## Why this matters
- Prevents role drift and ad hoc behaviour
- Improves managed delegation between agents
- Enables consistent KPI and learning evidence
- Makes new agent onboarding repeatable

## Contract elements
- mission and scope boundaries
- trigger sources (event/schedule/state)
- autonomy tier and approval requirements
- handoff packet requirements
- runtime preferences (including local-model-first)
- KPI expectations
- learning obligations

## Immediate value
- clearer accountability per agent
- reduced task drop-off when out-of-scope
- consistent safety controls across roles
- better comparability in dashboard evidence
