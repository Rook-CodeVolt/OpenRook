# Before vs After: Improvement Matrix

A high-level comparison of platform posture before and after OpenRook-style hardening and role specialization.

| Area | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Agent model | generic responses | role-specialized multi-agent responsibilities |
| Delegation | ad hoc handoffs | explicit role-to-role operating model |
| Feedback use | inconsistent | auditable feedback usage expectations |
| Reliability | fragmented checks | clearer pipeline and monitoring posture |
| Asset durability | mixed persistence patterns | durable backend-centric persistence patterns |
| Environment handling | environment-specific assumptions | stronger environment-safe routing patterns |
| Context/memory | high drift risk | compact recall and memory optimization loops |
| Reporting | variable quality | structured operator-ready daily briefing patterns |
| Security posture | periodic/manual | stronger continuous guardrail and hardening stance |
| Reuse of knowledge | repeated rework | growing skills/playbook foundation |
| Cost posture | avoidable token churn | local-model-first heavy-lift strategy |

## How to use this matrix

Use this table as an adoption checklist. For each row:
1. define your current state,
2. define your target state,
3. attach evidence and owners,
4. review progress weekly.
