# Daily Progress Reflection — 2026-02-21

## What was achieved
- Delivery plan execution advanced from partial implementation to full-phase completion and validation.
- Production-readiness UAT was executed with fix-forward handling until clean pass.
- Agent coordination visibility improved across Command Centre and Learning/Agents pages.
- Autonomous operation controls were strengthened with measured tasking and governance-aware guardrails.
- Continuous release-gate and UAT operations were operationalized for ongoing reliability.

## Outcome highlights (public-safe)
- Core capability roadmap milestones were completed and validated end-to-end.
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns were implemented and are observable in dashboard telemetry.
- Evidence-first operations now drive readiness decisions (not subjective status updates).
- DR resilience posture improved with GitHub-backed evidence manifests.

## Product-level improvements
- Command Centre now surfaces richer operational proof signals.
- Learning view shifted from legacy progression framing toward production telemetry.
- Agents view now reflects live orchestration context and actionable status.

## Reflection
Today’s work moved the platform from "feature build" into "controlled operations":
- repeatable validation,
- clear governance gates,
- measurable agent behavior,
- and safer publication boundaries.

This establishes a stronger foundation for sustainable autonomous iteration.

## Public boundary
This summary intentionally omits credentials, private infrastructure details, and implementation internals that could weaken security posture.
