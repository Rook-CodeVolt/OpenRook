# Drift Guard Value Note (Public-safe) — 2026-02-19

## Why this control matters
A drift guard ensures structural platform changes are accompanied by operational documentation updates, which improves reliability, auditability, and disaster recovery continuity.

## Practical value
- Prevents silent architecture drift
- Improves incident recovery speed
- Enforces change-to-runbook traceability
- Supports autonomous delivery with accountable evidence

## Tuning principle
A good drift guard should be strict on undocumented structural change while recognizing current documentation architecture to avoid unnecessary friction.
