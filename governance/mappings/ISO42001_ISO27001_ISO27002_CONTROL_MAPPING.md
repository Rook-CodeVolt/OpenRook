# Mapping: ISO/IEC 42001 + ISO/IEC 27001:2022 + ISO/IEC 27002:2022

## Purpose
Provide a practical mapping for AI/agent governance and information security controls.

## High-level crosswalk

| Governance theme | ISO/IEC 42001 intent | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 alignment | ISO/IEC 27002:2022 focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Governance and accountability | AI management responsibilities | ISMS context, leadership, roles | organizational controls |
| Risk management | AI-specific risk lifecycle | risk assessment/treatment | risk treatment guidance controls |
| Asset and data governance | AI system/data control | asset, information security controls | data handling and classification |
| Access and operation | Controlled AI operation | access control, operations security | identity/access/operations controls |
| Monitoring and improvement | AI performance and oversight | performance evaluation, improvement | monitoring, logging, review practices |
| Incident handling | AI incident response and learning | incident management | incident response controls |

## Implementation note
Use this mapping to build one integrated control library rather than separate, duplicated programs.
