# Mapping: ISO/IEC 42001 + ISO/IEC 27001:2022 + ISO/IEC 27002:2022

## Purpose
Provide a practical crosswalk to implement one integrated governance/control model.

## Crosswalk table (high-level)
| Control Theme | AI Governance Intent (ISO 42001) | ISMS Alignment (ISO 27001:2022) | Control Guidance Focus (ISO 27002:2022) | Example Artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Governance & accountability | AI roles, responsibilities, oversight | Leadership, roles, policy, objectives | Organizational controls | governance charter, RACI, council minutes |
| Risk management | AI-specific risk lifecycle | Risk assessment & treatment | risk-related control guidance | risk register, treatment plans |
| Asset/data governance | AI assets/data governance | Asset and information security controls | data classification/handling controls | data inventory, handling standards |
| Access & operations | Controlled AI/agent operation | access control + operations security | IAM and operational controls | RBAC matrices, access reviews |
| Change and release | managed AI/model/agent change | change management in ISMS operation | secure change control guidance | change records, rollback evidence |
| Monitoring & logging | AI behavior/performance monitoring | performance evaluation and monitoring | logging/monitoring controls | SIEM dashboards, audit logs |
| Incident management | AI incident handling and learning | incident management requirements | incident response controls | incident runbooks, PIR reports |
| Continuity & resilience | continuity of AI-enabled services | business continuity planning | resilience and backup controls | DR tests, backup reports |
| Continual improvement | optimization and corrective actions | improvement requirements | review and optimization controls | CAPA logs, control test reports |

## Implementation guidance
1. Build a unified control catalog with IDs.
2. Map each control to owners, evidence, and review cadence.
3. Track operating effectiveness and remediation status.
4. Use one governance dashboard for AI + security control health.
