# Robust Deployment Patterns for AI + Agents

## Pattern 1: Tiered autonomy
Start with observe/suggest modes; progressively allow low-risk automation with evidence.

## Pattern 2: Segregated environments
Separate dev/test/prod with distinct credentials and policy controls.

## Pattern 3: Policy-enforced action boundaries
Use allowlists, approval gates, and auditable execution paths.

## Pattern 4: Event-driven orchestration
Trigger agents from telemetry/events; avoid expensive constant polling.

## Pattern 5: Local-model-first operations
Use local models for routine tasks; escalate selectively for complex cases.

## Pattern 6: Continuous control verification
Run periodic control checks, tabletop tests, and incident drills.
