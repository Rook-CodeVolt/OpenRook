# AI and Agent Governance Framework

## 1. Governance objectives
- Safe, lawful, and value-driven AI/agent adoption
- Clear accountability and decision rights
- Risk-managed autonomy with human oversight
- Measurable continual improvement

## 2. Governance operating model
### 2.1 Three lines of accountability
1. **Business/System owners** — accountable for outcomes and risk acceptance
2. **Risk/Security/Compliance** — define controls and independent challenge
3. **Assurance/Internal audit** — verify design and operating effectiveness

### 2.2 Governance forums
- **Weekly AI operations forum:** incidents, metrics, approvals
- **Monthly governance council:** policy exceptions, control health
- **Quarterly executive review:** strategic risk, investment, roadmap

## 3. Core governance artifacts
- AI strategy and scope statement
- AI/agent inventory with owners and criticality
- risk register with treatment plans
- model/agent evaluation evidence
- autonomy approval matrix and logs
- incident and post-incident reviews

## 4. Lifecycle governance gates
1. Intake and risk classification
2. Design and threat/risk assessment
3. Build and controlled validation
4. Deployment approval
5. Runtime monitoring and incident handling
6. Change/release and retirement governance

## 5. Control domains
- Governance, policy, and accountability
- Data governance and privacy
- Identity and access management
- Agent/tool action safety and approval
- Logging/monitoring and auditability
- Resilience, continuity, and recovery
- Third-party and supply-chain assurance

## 6. Minimum required controls
- Role-based access with least privilege
- Segregated environments and credentials
- Risk-tiered autonomy controls
- Approval workflows for non-low-risk actions
- Tamper-evident logging and retention
- Backup/restore runbooks and tested recovery

## 7. KPI model (example)
- % governed AI/agent systems in inventory
- % high-risk actions with explicit approval evidence
- incident rate and MTTR for agent-enabled workflows
- policy exception volume and age
- control test pass rate

## 8. Continuous improvement
- recurring issue classes converted into reusable controls/skills
- periodic policy and control tuning
- lessons learned integrated into playbooks/templates
